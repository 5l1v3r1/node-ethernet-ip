# Node Ethernet/IP

This is a project that I am working on with the intent on creating a highly intuitive and easy to use Ethernet/IP API for interfacing ControlLogix and CompactLogix PLCs.

# Developement Status

I am only working on this at the moment as a *pet* project in my free time though I am working consistently and will continue to add features as things proceed. This said, anyone with network experience and a node background is welcome to reach out to me via the contact form on my [website](http://www.canaanseaton.com/) or by email.

#### Abbreviated Task List

- [x] Build Ethernet/IP Encapsulation Helper Library
